Murray is a[n esoteric] programming language named after the talking demonic skull in Monkey Island

some notes on design principles:

the compiler must be written in murray (eventually)

murray compiles to python

murray is a lisp for python

but without the parentheses

the code should be short and succint, but not so much as golfscript, the idea is elegance (and funnines)

####
TODO
####

figure out why the equivalent of "else" doesn't work in question (consuming two arguments, which are both functions with their own arguments)

looping constructs

user-defined functions

optional arguments

memoisation


#####
Language Spec
####

This is where the language specifications go as I think of them

Lines starting with # are ignored (comments)

Single-character functions are left-connectable -> interpreted as functions even when last character of something else

Functions can take any number of argumetns from either the right or the left side
