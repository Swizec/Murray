Murray is a[n esoteric] programming language named after the talking demonic skull in Monkey Island

some notes on design principles:

the compiler must be written in murray (eventually)

murray compiles to python

murray is a lisp for python

but without the parentheses

the code should be short and succint, but not so much as golfscript, the idea is elegance (and funnines)

TODO
####

Need to change direction of code parsing
must make stuff more rebolish in the sense that functions only expect so many params



#####
Language Spec

This is where the language specifications go as I think of them

Lines starting with # are ignored (comments)
